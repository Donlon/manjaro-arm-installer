# Manjaro ARM Installer

Scripts for installing Manjaro ARM directly to SD/eMMC cards or USB sticks without the need for images.

This script is "interactive". Meaning that it asks you questions when run to customize your install. Like username, password etc.


## Dependencies (Arch package names):
* bash
* wget
* git
* systemd
* dialog
* parted
* libarchive
* binfmt-qemu-static
* openssl
* gawk
* dosfstools
* polkit
* btrfs-progs (for btrfs filesystem support)
* f2fs-tools (for f2fs filesystem support)
* cryptsetup (for encryption support)

## Installing and using from Manjaro (x64 and ARM) repositories:
To use this script, please make sure that the following is correct:

* An SD/eMMC card with at least 8 GB storage is plugged in, but not mounted. This Script **will** remove everything on it.
* That your user account has `sudo` rights.

Then install the `manjaro-arm-installer` package with:
```
sudo pacman -Syu manjaro-arm-installer
```
Then reboot or run `sudo systemctl restart systemd-binfmt`. You can now launch the installer with:
```
sudo bash manjaro-arm-installer
```


## Installing and using from gitlab:
To use this script, please make sure that the following is correct:

* An SD/eMMC card or USB stick with at least 8 GB storage is plugged in, but not mounted. This Script **will** remove everything on it.
* That your user account has `sudo` rights.
* That you have rebooted or restarted the binfmt service with `sudo systemctl restart systemd-binfmt`.

Then use this to get it:
```
git clone https://gitlab.manjaro.org/manjaro-arm/applications/manjaro-arm-installer
cd manjaro-arm-installer
chmod +x manjaro-arm-installer
sudo bash ./manjaro-arm-installer
```

## Known Issues:
* Because `dialog` is weird, the script needs to be run in `bash`.

## Other notes:

This script **should** be distro-agnostic, which means you can install *Manjaro ARM* from **any** distro, as long as the dependencies are met.
